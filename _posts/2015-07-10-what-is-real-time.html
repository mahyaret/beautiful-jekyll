<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">When the simulation clock reaches a certain time in real-time simulation, the same amount of time must have passed in the real world.<br /><br /><br />Real-Time Windows Target™ (now Simulink Desktop Real-Time™) and xPC Target™ (now Simulink Real-Time™) are no the same!<br /><br />&nbsp;Simulink<sup>®</sup> Real-Time™ lets you create real-time applications from Simulink models and run them on dedicated target computer hardware connected to your physical system. It supports real-time simulation and testing, including rapid control prototyping, DSP and vision system prototyping, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation.<br /><br />&nbsp;Simulink<sup>®</sup> Desktop Real-Time™ provides a real-time kernel for executing Simulink models on a Windows<sup>®</sup> or Mac laptop or desktop. It includes library blocks that connect to a range of I/O devices. You can create and tune a real-time system for rapid prototyping or hardware-in-the-loop simulation with your computer.<br /><br />Simulink Real-Time provides native I/O drivers and functions for target computer hardware  purchased directly from the respective hardware manufacturer, which  provides backward compatibility for target applications built with xPC  Target™,&nbsp;                                                                            Simulink Desktop Real-Time™ provides a real-time kernel for executing Simulink<sup>®</sup> models on a laptop or desktop running Windows<sup>®</sup> or Mac OS X. It includes library blocks that connect to a range of I/O devices.</div>
