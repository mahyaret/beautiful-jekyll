<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">here is a description of the DRC error messages:<br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Angle:</i><br /><i>Tracks   are not laid in an angle of 0, 45, 90 or 135Â°. This check can be   switched on or off in the Design Rules (Misc tab). Default: off.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Blind Via Ratio:</i><br /><i>The   limit of the ratio of via length (depth) to drill diameter is exceeded.   In this case you have to adjust the via's drill diameter (Design Rules,   Sizes tab) or the layer thickness of your board (Design Rules, Layers   tab).</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Clearance:</i><br /><i>Clearance   violation between copper objects. The settings of the Design Rules'   Clearance tab and the value for Clearance of a given net class are taken   into consideration. Of these two values the higher one is taken for</i><br /><i>checking.   In addition the Isolate value will be taken into consideration for   polygons with the same rank and polygons which are defined as a part of a   Package. To deactivate the clearance check between objects that belong   to the same signal, use the value 0 for Same signals in the Clearance   tab. Micro Vias are treated like wires. The clearance value for wire to   wire applies in this case.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Dimension:</i><br /><i>Distance   violation between SMDs, pads, and connected copper objects and a   dimension line (drawn in Layer 20, Dimension), like the board's   outlines. Defined through the value for Copper/Dimension in the Design   Rules'</i><br /><i>Distance tab.Setting the value Copper/Dimension to   0 deactivates this check. In this case polygons do not keep a minimum   distance to objects in layer 20, Dimension, and holes! The DRC will not   check if holes are placed on tracks then!</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Drill Distance:</i><br /><i>Distance violation between holes. Defined by the value Drill/Hole in the Design Rules (Distance tab).</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Drill Size:</i><br /><i>Drill   diameter violation in pads, vias, and holes. This value is defined in   the Design Rules' Sizes tab, Minimum Drill. It is also possible to   define a special drill diameter for vias in a given net class (CLASS   command, Drills). In this case the higher one is used for the check.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Invalid Polygon:</i><br /><i>Reason   is a not properly drawn polygon contour. As soon as the contour lines   are overlapping or even crossing, the polygon can't be calculated   correctly. Change the polygon's contour in the Layout Editor or in the   Library, if it is part of a Package. The RATSNEST command shows this   error message, as well.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Keepout:</i><br /><i>Restricted   areas for components drawn in layer 39, tKeepout, or 40, bKeepout, lie   one upon another. This check is executed only if layers 39 and 40 are   displayed and if the keepout areas are already defined in the Package   Editor of the library. </i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Layer Abuse:</i><br /><i>Layer   17, Pads, or 18, Vias, contain objects which are not automatically   generated by EAGLE. Probably you drew something manually in these   layers, although they are reserved for pads and vias. Better move such   objects into another layer.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Layer Setup:</i><br /><i>This   error is shown if an object in a layer is found that is not defined by   the Layer setup. The same for vias that do not follow the settings of   the Layer setup, for example, if a via has an illegal length   (Blind/Buried vias). </i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Micro Via Size: </i><br /><i>The drill diameter of the micro via is smaller than the value given for Min. Micro Via in the Sizes tab.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>No Vector Font:</i><br /><i>The   font check (Design Rules, Misc tab) recognizes text in a signal layer   which is not written in EAGLE's internal vector font. If you want to   generate manufacturing data with the help of the CAM Processor the   texts, at least in the signal layers, ought to be written in vector   font. This is the only font the CAM Processor can work with.&nbsp; Otherwise   the board will not look the same as it is shown. Change the font with   the help of the command CHANGE FONT or use the option Always vector font   in the Layout Editor's Options/User Interface menu: If activated, the   Layout Editor shows all texts in vector font. This is the way the   manufactured board will look like.</i><br /><i>Activating the   sub-option Persistent in this drawing saves the setting in the drawing   file. If you send the layout file, for example, to the board house you   can be sure that the vector font will be displayed also at his system.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>No real vector font:</i><br /><i>The   font check (Design Rules, Misc tab) recognizes text in a signal layer   which is not written in EAGLE's internal vector font although it is   displayed as vector font in the Layout Editor window. This situation   arises if the</i><br /><i>option Always vector font in the menu Options/User Interface is active. See error message No vector font for further details.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Off Grid:</i><br /><i>The   object does not fit onto the currently chosen grid. This check can be   switched on or off in the Design Rules' Misc tab. The default setting is   off, because as soon as trough-hole and surface-mount parts are used   together it's not easily possible to find a reasonable common grid. The   check is set off by default.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Overlap:</i><br /><i>DRC reports this error as soon as two copper elements with different signals touch each other.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Restrict:</i><br /><i>A   wire drawn in layer 1, Top, or 16, Bottom, or a via lies in a   restricted area which is defined in layer 41 or 42, t/bRestrict. If   restricted areas and copper objects are defined in a common Package, the   DRC does not check them!</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Stop Mask:</i><br /><i>If   there are silkscreen objects drawn in layers 21, 25, 27 for components   on the Top layer, and 22, 26, and 28 for components on the Bottom layer   overlapping the area of a solder stop symbol generated in layer 29 and   30,</i><br /><i>the DRC reports a Stopmask error. You have to display   the corresponding layers to activate this check! Please keep in mind   that this check always takes the vector font as basis for the   calculation of the required space. This is the font type the CAM   Processor uses for manufacturing data generation.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Width:</i><br /><i>Minimum   width violation of a copper object. Defined by Minimum Width in the   Design Rules (Sizes tab) or, if defined, by the track parameter Width of   a referring net class. The higher one of the given values will be taken   for </i><i>this check. Also the line width of vector font texts in signal layers will be checked. </i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><i>Wire Style:</i><br /><i>The   DRC treats a line (wire) whose Style is LongDash, ShortDash or DashDot   in the same way as a continuous line. If a wire drawn with one of these   styles is laid as a signal, the DRC reports a Wire Style error.</i><br /><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="height: 8pt; min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;"><br /></div>Concerning   ERC there is no description of the messages.ERC checks logical things   in the schematic. The messaged are about connections, supply pins and so   on. There is no rule what you have to do with a certain message. Simply   read it and decide whether this is okay or not. </div>
