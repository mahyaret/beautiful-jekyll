<div class="hgroup"><h1 class="title">Squid - Proxy Server</h1></div><div class="contents"><div class="para">Squid is a full-featured web proxy cache server application  which provides proxy and cache services for Hyper Text           Transport Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and  other popular network protocols.  Squid can implement           caching and proxying of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) requests  and caching of Domain Name Server (DNS) lookups, and perform           transparent caching. Squid also supports a wide variety of  caching protocols, such as Internet Cache Protocol (ICP),           the Hyper Text Caching Protocol (HTCP), the Cache Array  Routing Protocol (CARP), and the Web Cache Coordination            Protocol (WCCP).           </div><div class="para">The Squid proxy cache server is an excellent solution to a  variety of proxy and caching server needs, and scales from           the branch office to enterprise level networks while providing  extensive, granular access control mechanisms, and           monitoring of critical parameters via the Simple Network  Management Protocol (SNMP).  When selecting a computer system           for use as a dedicated Squid caching proxy server for many  users ensure it is configured with a large amount of physical           memory as Squid maintains an in-memory cache for increased  performance.&nbsp;</div><div class="para"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="para">1: </div></div><pre class="contents "><span class="cmd command">sudo apt-get install squid3</span>&nbsp;</pre><pre class="contents ">&nbsp;</pre><div class="contents ">2:</div><pre class="contents ">&nbsp;sudo nano /etc/squid3/squid.conf</pre><div class="contents "><br /></div><div class="contents ">3:simply find the following line and change "deny" to "allow".
