I am currently a Machine Learning Researcher at [Epson](https://epson.ca/). My areas of research are Robotic Grasping and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I used to work as a R&D Software Engineer at [Dematic](http://www.dematic.com/), I contributed to the research and development of the Dematic flagship product for supply chain solution ["Dematic Multi-Shuttle (DMS)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQq_S4RoSKM). I've also developed automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing to releasing in an Agile system. During my PhD, I’ve been leading a challenging project of designing and developing a robot for autonomous harvesting of an agricultural good under stringent design requirements. I have excellent theoretical background in Robotics, Machine Learning, and Software development with extensive hands-on experience in electronic design, and mechanical design which allow me to successfully implement projects from scratch.

As a programmer, personally, I'm passionate about developing Free Software. “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. I believe users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. I think when users don't control the program, the program controls the users. The developer manages the program, and through it controls the users. A nonfree or “proprietary” program is, therefore, an instrument of unjust power. During high school, I published an article on open source and free software philosophy in an Iranian newspaper (Khabar newspaper) which you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2qUWADY_c8kZEdGV0RVTW4zYzA) (in Persian).

I enjoy cycling too. Once, Farshad and I decided to do something special; we arranged 100 miles road bike ride to the Tomb of Cyrus the Great, Pasargad, Iran. We started cycling on 8/12/2010 Tuesday at 4:00 AM, and it took almost 10 hours. It was tough, but it was worth it!

I am also desperate for adrenaline!
